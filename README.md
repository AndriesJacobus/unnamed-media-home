### Customer Base

* Share our beliefs
* Resipricates respect
* Can follow through
* Are open-minded
* Are patient and accepting to rapid change
* Have a passion for what they are doing

When a client has these characteristics, we offer them services which include (mainly):
* Basic Web-presence services (like using WordPress)
* Social Media Management and Marketing services (like creating and managing of fb pages)
* Custom Software services (like creating a delivery fleet management system)

### Product Features
At the moment the "product" that we are advancing is the media house itself. The media house deals in services (consulting, development, etc) to clients.
